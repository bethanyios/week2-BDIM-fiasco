## Installation

To run our tests, you'll need to do the following:

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/fac18/week2-BDIM-fiasco)
2. `cd` into the directory
3. run `npm install`

This will install _tape_, _tap-spec_, _nodemon_ and _nyc_ as dev-dependencies, since these are listed in our `package.json` file.

You can then run `npm test` to run the tests, or `npm run coverage` to run nyc alongside.

## Tracking progress

### User stories

So our user is some very disorganised person, who wants to be able to:

- [] enter tasks into a web page in order to remember them
- [] 

## Stretch goals

## Presentation
