# Week 2: BDIM Fiasco

## Installation

To run our tests, you'll need to do the following:

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/fac18/week2-BDIM-fiasco)
2. `cd` into the directory
3. run `npm install`

This will install _tape_, _tap-spec_, _nodemon_ and _nyc_ as dev-dependencies, since these are listed in our `package.json` file.

You can then run `npm test` to run the tests, or `npm run coverage` to run nyc alongside.

### Learning Outcomes

- [] 

### User stories

So, our user is some very disorganised person, who wants to be able to:

- [x] enter tasks so that I don't forget them
- [x] view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
- [x] mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
- [x] the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb
- [x] once a list item added clear the input 

### Potential stretch goals

As a disorganised person I want to:

- [] edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
- [x] click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
- [x] a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing (ISH! we didn't get to the edit stretch goal, but we added a subtle scale on hover to show which todo we're interacting with)

## Process

This week was quite different to the last, although we were still in the same team! After reading the project readme, we had a little peek back at our retrospective notes, to see how we hoped to approach future projects. Some of these things were:

- [x] continue mobbing the HTML
- [x] switch up pairs
- [x] leave our comfort zones
- [x] continue asking for and offering help
- [x] ensure we all understand the codebase, even the stuff we haven't written
- [] make more granular commits (SOME of us!)
- [x] have fun! âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“

### Mobbing first tests

As TDD is still a pretty new and unfamiliar concept, we thought mobbing our first logic function together would be a great way to learn.

We really loved this approach, and even though it took the four of us 3 hours to write about 7 lines of code... 

`addTodo: function (todos, newTodo) {
    var allTodos = this.cloneArrayOfObjects(todos);
    newTodo.id = this.generateId(); // generate fresh id for newTodo
    newTodo.done = false;
    allTodos.push(newTodo); // add newTodo to cloned array
    return allTodos;
  },`

... we did write 137 lines of test on the way there. 

What a journey!

### Dividing functions between pairs

Cut to Thursday morning. The scent of freshly brewed coffee perfumes the air. Our heroes enter, and split up for some pair programming!

### Continued specific testing/functions per pair

addTodo tests :
* test that function appends newTodo to cloned todo array
* test that array length has increased by 1
* check that appended element is an object
* test original todos remains unchanged by checking length
* check newTodo has an id prop after appending
* test original todos remains unchanged by checking deep equality
  
### Wire frames/design meeting

We paused writing our logic and had a little brainstorm to get an overarching sense of how everything would fit together and how we wanted our Todo app to look.

### Css variables

We used coolors to choose a colour palette, and created these as variables in our root directory.

### Mobbing semantic HTML

### Granular ~~commits~~ comets

Some of us were great at remembering to commit regularly... @Beth.

Others, not so much... *cough* Reda *cough*. 

Something for next week!

### DOM in pairs

### Styling in pairs

## Tracking progress

We raised issues in github from the very beginning to track all our Todos! This was a goal we'd noted last week and we're pleased to say it worked really well for us in keeping everything very visible across the team.

## Stretch goals

* Sort functionality:
* *  Separating marked todos in another part of the webpage (alive > extinct)
* Adding animated interactions once a task completed 

## Things we learnt

- How to write simple failing tests, and use these to construct functions
- DOM!
- Almost every JS array method (map, every, forEach...)
- CSS variables are great for defining colour palettes and white space
- LET's all start CONSTantly use ES6 scoping: use const as a default, let if you are sure you need the functionality

By osmosis:
ðŸ˜Ž We're pretty much gitflow ninjas now.

## Things that went wrong

- Forgetting to return something at the end of our functions and wondering why our tests weren't working. This happened more times than we'd care to admit.

- Our DOM disappeared, taking all our todos with it!
- Wrapping of todos and input - for a while they were overflowing to the next line
- Merge conflicts: there was an instance when half a function ended up in the middle of another function. A strange quirk, but it taught us just how eagle-eyed we have to be when resolving conflicts

We left our accessibility audit til quite late in the day on Thursday; we'd want to ideally check accessibility as we go along.
 
Don't forget about basic stuff: like html lang, link titles and form labels in your index.html.
